	<h2>What is ML?</h2>
	<p>
		ML (MetaLanguage), is a general purpose functional programming language
		with popular derivatives including F# and OCaml.

	<h2>An Introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks</h2>
	<h3>Tom Read Cutting</h3>

	<aside class="notes">
		Aaaah, that's better!
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Workshop Goals</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Introduce Machine Learning</li>
		<li>Explain the theory behind simple Neural Networks</li>
		<li>Complete a fun neural network challenge</li>
		<li>Introduce a wide array of resources for further learning</li>
	</ol>

	<aside class="notes">
		Stress that I’m here to learn just as much as they are, I’m not an
		expert in machine learning as I only did a bit in undergrad. Also, the
		course I did covered a lot of things that weren’t neural nets, meaning
		we didn’t actually have time to cover those in depth. (The maths scared
		me, when it is actually quite straightforward).

		<h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>
		<p>
			You will need:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3</a></li>
			<li>A text editor</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We will also download these libraries later:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/hsjeong5/MNIST-for-Numpy">MNIST-for-Numpy</a></li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			Download Python whilst I'm talking, we will cover the other libraries
			later.

			Just leaving them here for reference...

			TODO: show an aside slide explaining how to download other libs.

		<h2>Why Python?</h2>
		<p>
		Basically, it is what everyone uses.
		</p>
		<p>
		It is an incredibly powerful interpreted language with many useful
		machine learning and visualisation libraries that can interact well
		with each other.
		</p>
		<p>
		Furthermore, python is incredibly widely used for other applications,
		allowing Python+ML to enhance those massively.
		(eg. Houdini+scikit-learn [2])

	<h2>What is Machine Learning and how does it relate to Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
	<p>
		Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of intelligent agents that are
		able to observe their environment and acts appropriately according to
		their circumstances and goals [1]. It’s a very hard and wishy-washy
		thing to define.
	</p>
	<p>
		Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI, and is when computers are
		designed to solve specific tasks using models and inference, as opposed
		to relying on explicit hard-coded instructions.
	</p>

		<h2>What types of machine learning are there?</h2>
		<p>There are three broad categories of machine learning</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Supervised Learning</li>
			<li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
			<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
		</ol>
